# NoSQL Social Network - Week 18 Challenge
# Details
The challenge is to build an API for a social network web app that allows its users to share thoughts, react to friend's thoughts and create a list of friends. It uses Express.js, Mongoose, and a MongoDB database. This is an un-deployed application, so included will be a video/gif walk-through demonstrating the functionality of the API/App.
